- **Custom Simulation Language**: Define your simulations easily with our tailored language.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Intuitive interface to visualize and interact with your simulations.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on various operating systems.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Engage with simulations in real-time for better understanding.
- **Extensive Libraries**: Utilizes libraries like ImGui, GLFW, and Implot for rich graphics and functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with Sim-OS, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/jocelchristian/sim-os/releases). This will provide you with the necessary files to execute the simulator on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- **CMake**: Make sure you have CMake installed on your system.
- **C++ Compiler**: A compiler that supports C++23, such as Clang or GCC.
- **Libraries**: Ensure you have the following libraries:
  - ImGui
  - GLFW
  - Implot
  - stb_image

## Usage

Once you have installed the simulator, you can start creating your simulations. Hereâ€™s a simple guide to get you going:

1. **Define Your Simulation**: Use the custom simulation description language to outline your simulation parameters.
2. **Load the Simulation**: Open the simulator and load your simulation file.
3. **Run the Simulation**: Click on the "Run" button to see your simulation in action.
4. **Interact**: Use the GUI to interact with your simulation, making adjustments as needed.
